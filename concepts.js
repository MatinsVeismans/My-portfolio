        A medical device that disables mind and allows to gain controls over humans' body parts limbs, mouth, etc. 
        Although there is no explanation how this is possible, it is thought to be dangerous and can cause risk of stroke, dementia, etc.
        I imagined that to use the device you would connect many electrodes to your brain and use high voltage and current to active it...
        The device would use joystick to control legs and arms, buttons for various functions, and keyboard to speak.
